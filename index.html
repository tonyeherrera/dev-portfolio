                        <p> This project is my favorite by far. This web application allows visitors to view drink recipies with the help of a third party api. Recipes are searchable by name, ingredient, or alcoholic/non-alcoholic. Recipes can also be added to a list and saved in local storage for later viewing.</p>
                        <p> There is a user authenticated portion of the site ("Library Card") where visitors can signup to view recipe submissions from other users and add their own. This portion of the site is still under construction.</p>

                        <p>"Rock The Vote" was an assignment for the final level of the curiculum at V School. The goal was to create a web application that required user authentication and maintained data via MongoDB database and api routes using Node.js with Express and Mongoose. </p>

                        <p>This site was a colloboration project that I created with fellow student Tyler Kitchens. We were to create a web application whose data was maintained via MongoDB. Tyler and I shared in all portions of the build process, allowing us to both gain a better understanding of both server side and front-end development.</p>
